# Bike Sharing

## Overview of the Analysis:
 
 The purpose of this project is to analyze the data for New York City Citi Bike using Tableau Application. This project will provide a visual representation that shows where do bikers go, when and where do they ride, trips by gender during weekdays and weekends, and trip durations.

To view the data visualization, please click the link: [NYC Citi Bike Data Analytics](https://public.tableau.com/shared/4B2XNTCDX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


## Results:

- Trip Duration: Majority of the bikers have a trip duration of 5 minutes.
- Trip Duration by Gender: Males are more likely to ride than females.
- Starting Location: Majority of the rides have a Start Station: 40.7519, -73.9777 with a total of 16,564 rides.

## Summary:

Data Visualization is a very powerful tool to help business owners and executives to identify and analyze the market and trends. With this project, we can suggest that services and maintencance should be done during off-peak hours: 1:00 AM to 4:00 AM. We can also suggest to allocate more bikes in locations with high starting point as shown above.

Note: Starting Station Locations and Ending Station Locations are two visualizations that were added and are not part of the deliverables. I strongly think that these visualizations are good to have because they indicate where to allocate more bikes and these visualizations will alos give us information as to where bikers are riding and where do they go.
